### The Jungle Book Full Movie in Hindi 3GP: A Comparison with the Animated Film
  
The Jungle Book is not the first time that Disney has adapted Rudyard Kipling's stories into a film. In 1967, Disney released an animated musical comedy film of the same title, which was also based on Kipling's works. The animated film was one of Disney's most successful and beloved films of all time, and is considered a classic by many fans and critics.
  
However, the live-action film is not a direct remake of the animated film. Instead, it is a reimagining that draws inspiration from both Kipling's original stories and Disney's animated adaptation. The live-action film retains some of the elements from the animated film, such as the characters, the songs, and the humor, but also adds new elements that are closer to Kipling's vision, such as the darker tone, the realistic setting, and the cultural references.
  
Some of the differences between the two films are:

- The live-action film has more characters from Kipling's stories that were not featured in the animated film, such as Akela (the leader of the wolf pack), Raksha (Mowgli's adoptive mother), Grey Brother (Mowgli's wolf brother), Ikki (the porcupine), Rocky (the rhinoceros), and Pygmy Hog (the hog).
- The live-action film has less musical numbers than the animated film. The live-action film only includes two songs from the animated film: "The Bare Necessities" and "I Wanna Be Like You". The live-action film also has a new song by Richard M. Sherman called "Trust in Me", which is sung by Kaa during her encounter with Mowgli.
- The live-action film has a different ending than the animated film. In the animated film, Mowgli decides to leave the jungle and join a human village after he falls in love with a girl named Shanti. In the live-action film, Mowgli decides to stay in the jungle with his animal friends after he defeats Shere Khan with fire.

Both films have their own merits and appeal to different audiences. The animated film is more lighthearted and whimsical, while the live
