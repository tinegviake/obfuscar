In this article, we will take a closer look at what makes Syntorus 2 stand out from other chorus plugins on the market, and how you can use it to enrich your instruments with life and movement.
 
## What is Syntorus 2?
 
Syntorus 2 is a triple path analog chorus plugin that uses a high-quality BBD (bucket brigade device) analog delay line emulation to create a warm, musical and lush chorus sound. Unlike most chorus plugins that use only one delay line, Syntorus 2 employs three independent delay lines that can be configured in various ways to achieve different sonic results.
 
Each delay line has its own multimode filter and tremolo effect built in, both modulated by the same sources as the delay time. This allows you to create convincing Leslie sounds, simulate the Doppler effect of a rotating speaker, or add more dynamic variation to your sound.
 
Syntorus 2 also features three LFO generators that serve as flexible modulation sources for the delay lines. You can choose from six waveforms, sync them to your host DAW tempo, adjust their phase offset for left and right channels, and invert their amplitude. You can also switch between three LFO-to-delay-line routing configurations to create different modulation patterns.
 
## Why choose Syntorus 2?
 
There are many reasons why you might want to use Syntorus 2 for your music production. Here are some of them:
 
- Syntorus 2 offers a realistic and accurate emulation of an analog BBD delay line, with an option to add extra analog character with the Analog BBD Emulation mode.
- Syntorus 2 gives you more control and flexibility over your chorus sound than most plugins, thanks to its three delay lines, three LFOs, filters and tremolos.
- Syntorus 2 can produce a wide range of chorus effects, from subtle thickening and widening to rich and deep modulation and spatialization.
- Syntorus 2 can enhance any instrument with its analog chorus sound, whether it is a synth bass, a lead, a guitar, or an electric/acoustic instrument.
- Syntorus 2 has a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and adjust. It also has a tag-based preset browser that helps you find the right sound quickly.
- Syntorus 2 has a MIDI-learn functionality that lets you assign any parameter to your MIDI controller for hands-on tweaking.

## How to use Syntorus 2?
 
Using Syntorus 2 is very simple and intuitive. Here are some basic steps to get you started:

1. Load Syntorus 2 as an insert effect on your instrument track.
2. Choose a preset from the browser or start from scratch by clicking on the Init button.
3. Adjust the Mix knob to set the balance between the dry and wet signals.
4. Select one of the three delay line models: Clean BBD (default), Analog BBD Emulation or Digital Delay.
5. Tweak the Delay Time knob to set the length of the delay line. You can also modulate it with one of the LFOs by dragging the Mod knob up or down.
6. Adjust the Feedback knob to set the amount of signal that is fed back into the delay line. Be careful not to set it too high or you might get unwanted feedback loops.
7. Select one of the four filter modes: Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass or Notch. Then adjust the Cutoff and Resonance knobs to shape the tone of the delayed signal. You can also modulate them with one of the LFOs by dragging the Mod knobs up or down.
